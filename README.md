This project is dedicated to the automation, creating and visualisation of NBA 2K e-sports matches for the French and European leagues.

This is a paid project for one of my client.

One of the tricky part is that in order to get data from matches, I needed to do some OCR on what are called boxscores - they are the data about the match that appear at each match's end.
